M.S. in Enterprise Risk Management, actively looking for jobs in Risk Analyst and Data Analyst

This project contains a market risk modelling program using Python coding to measure the Value-at-Risk (VaR) and Expected-Shortfall (ES) using historical simulation, Geometric Brownian Motion and Monte Carlo Simulation.

By Python coding environment, I established a portfolio of Ford and Xerox’s stock and S&P 500 Index Options, measured its Market Risk by computing Historical VaR, Monte Carlo VaR and Geometric Brownian Motion VaR over 20 years observation, visualized the data, and conducted a Backtesting process for Model Validation that ended up in two huge spikes during the observation period—one in the Dot-Com Bubble, and the other in the 2008 Financial Crisis.

Three documentation are composed at the same time: Model Documentation, Software Design Documentation, and Test plan and its Result Documentation.
